## Project Overview

This project is a clone of the Fidelity website built using the Vite React framework. The goal is to create a responsive and modern web application that mimics the design and functionality of the Fidelity website. The application includes a Home page, About page, Team page, and Contact page. The project utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and leverages components from Tailblock and Flowbite to create a cohesive user interface.

## Project Structure

### Components
The project is structured around reusable React components. Components are the building blocks of the application, and each page is composed of multiple components. The components are designed to be modular, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

### Layouts
After creating the components, layouts are developed to define the structure of each page. Layouts ensure consistency across the application and provide a framework for placing the components on the page.

### Pages
Once the components and layouts are in place, the individual pages (Home, About, Team, Contact) are created. Each page is assembled by combining the relevant components within the layout structure.

### Routing
React Router DOM is used to handle navigation between the different pages of the application. The router ensures that users can navigate seamlessly between pages without reloading the entire application.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite:** A fast build tool that serves as the foundation for the React application, offering a better development experience.
- **React:** The JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application.
- **Tailblock:** A collection of ready-to-use Tailwind CSS blocks, used for quickly building out the UI components.
- **Flowbite:** A set of pre-designed components built with Tailwind CSS, used to enhance the UI/UX.
- **React Router DOM:** A routing library for React, used to manage navigation and dynamic content.

## Project Workflow

1. **Component Development:** The project starts with creating individual components that will be used across different pages. Components are designed to be reusable and customizable.

2. **Layout Creation:** Once the components are ready, layouts are created to define the structure of each page. Layouts serve as the blueprint for assembling the components.

3. **Page Assembly:** The final step involves assembling the pages by combining the components within the layouts. Each page (Home, About, Team, Contact) is built to reflect the structure and design of the Fidelity website.

4. **Routing Implementation:** React Router DOM is integrated to handle the navigation between pages. Routes are defined for each page, allowing users to move between them seamlessly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
